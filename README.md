# lexdrill

lexdrill prints a vocabulary word or phrase on demand, tracking how often each one has been shown.

## Installation

```bash
gem install lexdrill
```

### `lexdrill: command not found` after install?

This happens when the gem's executable directory isn't on your `PATH` — common with a
plain system Ruby (no rbenv/rvm). Fix it in one step:

**bash**
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.bindir'):\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**zsh**
```zsh
echo "export PATH=\"$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.bindir'):\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Using an rbenv-managed Ruby? Run `rbenv rehash` instead. Using rvm? You shouldn't hit
this — rvm keeps gem executable directories on `PATH` automatically.
